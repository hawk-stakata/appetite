# Appetite

Welcome to Appetite. This is a simple python app I created as part of a "Dev 101" training for my Project Manager and Account Manager colleagues at Hawkeye. The goal of this training is to give the Client Services team a basic understanding of some fundamental Dev concepts to facilitate cross discipline literacy. 

example.py was used to take screenshots and demonstrate what you might use variables, arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, and objects for

appetite.py is a working app that uses each concept from the training in the context of a fictional restaurant. I chose a brunch restaurant to use as a metaphor because it is relatable to non-technical teams. My hope with this metaphor is that it will help team members learn the basic purpose of each concept, and how they work together to form a complete app.

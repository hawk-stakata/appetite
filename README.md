Welcome to Appetite. This is a simple python app I created as part of a "Dev 101" training for my Project Manager and Account Manager colleagues at Hawkeye. The goal of this training is to give the Client Services team a basic understanding of some fundamental Dev concepts to facilitate cross discipline literacy.
